Ethereum is a blockchain based distributed computing platform where users may exchange currency (Ether), provide or purchase services (smart contracts), mint their own coinage (tokens), as well as other applications. The Ethereum network is fully decentralised, managed by public-key cryptography, peer-to-peer networking, and proof-of-work to process/verify transactions.

The Ethereum network is fully decentralised, managed by public-key cryptography, peer-to-peer networking, and proof-of-work to process/verify transactions.The goal of this coursework is to apply the techniques of Big Data Processing to analyse the full set of transactions which have occurred on the Ethereum network; from the first transactions (14-02-2016) till 30-06-2019. I have created several Map/Reduce programs to perform multiple types of computation.
